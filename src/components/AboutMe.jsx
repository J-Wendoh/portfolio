        Iâ€™m Joanne Wendoh, a passionate developer with a love for creating
        seamless digital experiences. My journey in tech began at a young age,
        and I have since honed my skills in various programming languages and
        frameworks.

      <p className="mt-4">
        I enjoy collaborating with others and continually learning new
        technologies to improve my craft. When I'm not coding, you can find me
        exploring nature or experimenting in the kitchen!
